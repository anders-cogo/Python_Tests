# Python_Tests
Quick personal projects to play around in Python
These projects run the gambit of simple scripts from messing with basic operators to defining short functions to creating try-except blocks.  Each script will be labeled in order of their creation, and their contents will follow the (approximate) arc of the learnpython.org tutorial.  Thus far the only exception to this rule is Python_Test_5.py, which was created to test how the creation and modification of a .vimrc file affected the display.
